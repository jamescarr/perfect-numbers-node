#Example Node.JS app

This is an example node.js app I put together complete with
a jspec setup and project structure for development. specs 
will run given that ruby is running using version
1.8.x and are ran by calling

	jspec run --node

or for autospec like mode:
	jspec --node

which will execute specs on file change. Still trying to figure 
out how to have specs run against the get function. :)
